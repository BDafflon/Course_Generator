## Status : Version 4.0.0 beta 5
All features for this version has been implemented. The documentation is missing and some controls must be done in the translation.
In this version the undo feature has been temporarily disabled.

## History
I created Course Generator in 2008 for my first 100 km ultra trail. Since then, I added a lot of features and it has been used by a lot of french ultra-runner. Up to the version 3.88 it has been written in C# and now java is used in order to be cross platform (Windows, Mac OS and Linux) and multilingual. 

Course Generator is free (donation are welcome ;) ), multi platform (Windows, Mac and Linux), multi-language (currently English and French) and open source under GPL V3.

In order to works, Course Generator (also called CG) need a GPS file (GPX file) and some extra informations.

With Course Generator you can :

* Estimate your time on each point of the track. 
* Set field type (the difficulty to the track: road, track...) of each point of the track
* Set your health status and how it will evolve during the race
* Set the station time (to eat, to drink, to sleep...)
* Set the time limits on points of the track. CG will give you an alert if you are late
* Set the recovery value after a rest
* Set a name and a comment for each position of the track
* Take into account the effect of the night during
* Take into account the effect of the elevation (over 1500m)
* See your track on an OpenStreetMap map
* Generate a mini road book where you will see the track profile and all the most important information of your race (position name, time, hour, elevation, ascend...)
* Get statistics of your race
* Analyze a race
* Invert the track direction
* Define a new start point for "looping track"
* Insert an external track at the beginning or the end of a track
* Extract and save a part of the track
* Save all your specific settings in a CGX file (a Course Generator specific format)
* Have offline maps (OpenStreetMap)
